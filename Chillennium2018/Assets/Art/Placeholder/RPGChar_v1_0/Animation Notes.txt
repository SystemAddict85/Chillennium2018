Notes:

Most of the animations are created with having a basic framerate of 0 - 12 fps in mind (that's 80ms - 100ms per frame)

For the attacks you probably want to dublicate or hold frames.
Especially the holding frame of the strong attack (1st frame of each strong attack)
And the fist frame of the unarmed punch.

Additionally it might be good idea to hold the "gettinghit" frames to keep the character flying through the air.



The idle has 2 loops.
This means loop 1 should always be displayed, loop 2 with the blinking should be displayed randomly instead of loop 1.
